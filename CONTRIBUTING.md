# Contributing to the Lithophane Workbench

At first, thank you for trying the Workbench and for taking the time to contribute :)

## Found a bug?
- **Make sure that the bug was not already reported** by checking the issues or searchin in the FreeCAD Forum https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=30496
- If you could not find any open issues, you should create one (https://github.com/furti/FreeCAD-Lithophane/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
  - Enter as much information as possible into the issue template. **The FreeCAD Version Info is very important**

## Want to write some code?
 - First and foremost **don't rely on the development branch**. This branch might contain experimental stuff and the history is likely to be rewritten over time. So best to not base your work on top of it.
 
More to come... :)
